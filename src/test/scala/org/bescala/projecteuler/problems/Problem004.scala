 /**
  * A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product
  * of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 x 99.
  *
  * Task: Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
  *
  * Note: The stated problem can be solved for numbers with a larger number of digits.
  *
  * For example, for 5 digit numbers, the largest palindrome is 9966006699 = 99681 * 99979 and
  * this solution can be determined programmatically in under a second.
  *
  * In fact, it is possible to calculate the value of these palindrome for the product of two
  * numbers up-to 8 digits in around 5 seconds.
  *
  * Finding the right strategy for finding a fast solution is not straightforward. Use experiments to
  *find a good strategy. The 'fast' solution doesn't require tons of math...
