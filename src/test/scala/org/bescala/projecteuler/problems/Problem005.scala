   * 2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.
   * What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?
   *
   * TIP:
   * This problem can be easily by some observations
   * sequence 1 .. 20 contains the following prime numbers:
   *
   * 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 and 19
   *
   * So, the number should at least have these as factors, the remaining numbers can be written in terms
   * of prime factors as follows:
   *
   * 4  = 2 * 2         // need at least one extra 2
   * 6  = 2 * 3         // already covered
   * 8  = 2 * 2 * 2     // need another extra 2
   * 9  = 3 * 3         // need at least one extra 3
   * 10 = 2 * 5         // already covered
   * 12 = 2 * 2 * 3     // already covered if we cover previous cases
   * 14 = 2 * 7         // already covered
   * 15 = 3 * 5         // already covered
   * 16 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 // need another extra 2
   * 18 = 2 * 3 * 3     // already covered if we cover previous cases
   * 20 = 2 * 2 * 5     // already covered if we cover previous cases
