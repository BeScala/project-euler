/* Problem 25 - 1000-digit Fibonacci number

  The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:

  F(n) = F(n−1) + F(n−2), where F(1) = 1 and F(2) = 1.

  Hence the first 12 terms will be:

    F1  = 1
    F2  = 1
    F3  = 2
    F4  = 3
    F5  = 5
    F6  = 8
    F7  = 13
    F8  = 21
    F9  = 34
    F10 = 55
    F11 = 89
    F12 = 144

  The 12th term, F12, is the first term to contain three digits.

  What is the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain 1000 digits?
